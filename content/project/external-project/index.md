title: Improved indigenous chicken
---

The CBO has completed construction of a poultry house that will contain about 300 indigenous chicken. The choice of improved indigenous chicken follows their survival capacity in the extreme environment and ability to produce high quality eggs and meat. 

We anticipate to link with Research Institutions like [KALRO](https://www.kalro.org/) in order to get high quality improved breeds. While we will source food from our farm surplus produce, we will get additives from local stores in the region.
